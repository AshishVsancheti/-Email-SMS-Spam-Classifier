# Email-SMS-Spam-Classifier
# Overview
This project aims to develop a spam classifier utilizing machine learning methods to categorize emails and SMS messages as either spam or non-spam (ham). It encompasses tasks such as data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), preprocessing, and model construction to build an efficient spam detection system.
# Steps
# 1. Data Loading
The dataset, sourced from Kaggle, formed the basis of this project.
# 2. Data Cleaning
Unnecessary columns were removed from the dataset, and the remaining ones were renamed for better clarity. 
The target variable underwent label encoding to transform it into numerical values. 
Null and duplicate values were examined and managed, ensuring duplicate rows were retained only once.
